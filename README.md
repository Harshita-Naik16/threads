This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Overview

- This is one of my first major FullStack project where I'm trying to build threads app clone by myself.
- I am really excited and the first step was to choose the stack.
- I am following up with the docs of clerk and nextJs along with some youtube videos to get ideas.

## TechStack

- NextJs
- ReactJs
- TailwindCss
- Clerk (for Auth)

<!-- (These are the base tech stack that I have chosen) -->
<!-- Will be adding more tools as I develop and get to know about tools. -->
